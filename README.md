## Structure
#### Heuristics
There are 4 heuristics:

1. `Aggregate Height` is the sum of all heights of columns on the board
1. `Complete Lines` is the sum of lines completed
1. `Holes` is the number of holes present on the board
1. `Bumpiness` is the difference in height between all adjacent columns

#### Implementation
**Naive brute force algorithm (Greedy)** 

* Max lines cleared: 634
* Logging is available for debugging purposes
* Weights (a,b,c,d) are taken from the Internet

**Local Search**

* Not implemented (Shi Ya)

**Minimax**

* Not implemented

**Particle Swarm Optimization**

* Not implemented

**Genetic Algorithm**

* Not implemented

**Temporal Difference**

* Not implemented
